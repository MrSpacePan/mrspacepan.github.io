			<h1><center>A Fated Interview</center></h1>
			<p>Evan sat at the hotel bar looking into his drink wondering how he could save his job.
			Evan wrote articles for an up and coming news site called “The Daily Rhetoric”, a website 
			meant to give unbiased news and show both sides to various stories. Evan hated the website 
			but needed the work. He had a special assignment, as his boss put it, he had to go to Florida
			to interview a WW2 veteran who knew FDR. He hated doing fluff pieces but people were going to
			read it so he saw it as easy pay. His boss also paid for all travel expenses so he decided to 
			treat it as a mini vacation. After arriving in Florida and getting settled in the hotel, he decided 
			to go to the veteran’s house to get the interview over with. To his dismay though, when he got there 
			a wake had started. The interview seemed to have been cancelled.</p>
			
			<p>Evan went back to the hotel and went straight to the bar, thinking of how to tell his boss. Evan 
			had wrote a lackluster piece a protest that happened at a university in California, and now a cancelled
			interview. He knew he could not save his job so he decided to order drinks, then call his boss. After a 
			couple beers, rum and cokes, whiskeys, and a double shot of Vodka, he decided to call his boss. He struggled 
			to get his phone out of his pocket and struggled even more to call his boss. After spending about 10 minutes
			struggling on his phone an older man came to the bar and tried to help him sit. </p>

			<p>“What has you so distressed that you decided to drink your problems away at 2 in the afternoon?” 
			said the man.</p>
			
			<p>The only audible words Evan could muster were “Job” and “Dead”. At this point the man ordered some
			club sodas.</p>
			
			<p>“This should help you” the old man said while handing him the club soda.</p>
			
			<p>Evan did his best to drink it but most of it ended up on his shirt instead. After shaking off the first 
			drink Evan did his best to drink the rest. Evan then surprised the man and told him about the events that’s
			happened that day. The man seemed very sympathetic and even offered to help him. He helped to his hotel room 
			and gave him a card to look at when he sobered up. Evan stumbled to his bed and proceeded to knock out.</p>
			
			<p>Evan had woken up a couple times during the night but would only be up for about 20 minutes which he would
			spend in the bathroom. He finally got up for real at 8 AM but still felt awful. After about an hour in the
			bathroom he drank a bottle of water out of the mini fridge followed by some pain killers he had in his bag. 
			After cleaning himself up he decided to do what he used to do when he woke up after a day of drinking. He 
			checked his phone to see if he sent any messages, calls, or emails and then looked in his pockets. He found a 
			card with a familiar name on it, “Peter Wright”. The founder of “The World Report”, a famous newspaper that 
			turned into a worldwide news network, had the same name. Evan thought it couldn’t be the same man but then 
			remembered the man he met last night. He looked similar to Wright but he still couldn’t tell. This wouldn’t 
			be the first time he thought he met someone famous while drunk. He decided to order some breakfast and give
			the number on the card a call. Evan called the phone number and the man from last night picked up.</p>
			
			<p>“Hello this is Peter Wright, who is calling”</p>
			
			<p>“Hello, my name is Evan I woke up with your card in my pocket”</p>
			
			<p>“Oh, the drunk fellow from last night, how are you feeling now?”</p>
			
			<p>Evan and Peter kept exchanging novelties until Evan asked why he had his card.</p>
			
			<p>“Oh, do you not remember? Well yesterday you explained your predicament to me and I thought I would help 
			you out and offered you a chance to interview me. Would you still like to, I’m only in Florida for a couple 
			more days so I would like to do this now.” Peter said.</p>
			
			<p>Evan fell to the floor when hearing this. He had a chance to interview someone once considered the best 
			source in news. This would definitely save his job and get him a promotion on top of that.</p>
			
			<p>“Yes, I would love to do the interview does 2 o’clock today work?” Evan said trying to keep his composure.</p>
			
			<p>“Yes that sounds good, come to my room at that time it is 234.” Peter said as he hung up the phone.</p>
			
			<p>Evan got himself back up after the call ended. This interview could get him a better job and finally give 
			him the recognition he felt he deserved. After he finished his breakfast he decided to get ready for the 
			interview. He wrote down what he considered some of the best questions of his career and went through his 
			closet looking for nice clothes. The best outfit he could put together consisted of a button down shirt with 
			some dress pants. He originally came to interview a WW2 vet so he didn’t pack any suits. He looked in the 
			bathroom and he seemed presentable and after giving himself some words of encouragement, left for the
			interview. He left his room and saw room number 234 right across from him. He looked at his room and saw the 
			number 235 as he said “Really?” then went to the room. He knocked on the door and could hear the vibrations 
			going through it. The door opened and the conversation started right away.</p>
			
			<p>“Aw, you came you look better than you did yesterday” Peter said sarcastically.</p>
			
			<p>“You helped me to my room, you could’ve told me that you were across from me instead of the number?”
			Evan said back in a similar sarcastic tone.</p>
			
			<p>“Yes but I thought this would be more fun” Peter laughed as he finished that sentence than let Evan in.</p>
			
			<p>Peter and Evan sat down and Peter bought out his notepad, a recorder, and his questions.</p>
			
			<p>“You came prepared, that’s quite the change from yesterday.” Peter said to Evan</p>
			
			<p>“Well it’s not every day you get drunk, meet a news legend, and get a chance to interview him” Peter 
			said in a sarcastic tone</p>
			
			<p>“That is very true, but on my end I see a man who 24 hours ago I saw spill a drink on his shirt and could 
			barely say sentences, now turn into a professional. It’s quite amusing to me at least.” Peter said smugly.</p>
			
			<p>The interview started smoothly as Evan started with some very basic questions. Peter answered every
			question with eas. He had answered all these questions is previous interviews and started to get annoyed.</p>
			
			<p>“Are you even taking this seriously?” Peter said while very annoyed.</p>
			
			
			<p>“Yes, I just want to get the softball questions out of the way I know my boss wants them” Evan said a little
			concerned.</p>
		
			<p>“Why do you want to do this interview?” Peter said in a very serious tone.</p>
		
			<p>“Well it’s a great opportunity and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.” Evan said now even more concerned.</p>
		
			<p>“Give me the real answer.” Peter said angry now.</p>
		
			<p>“What do you mean?” Evan said a little scared now.</p>
		
			<p>“Give me the real reason you wanted to interview me now.” Peter said very stern now.</p>
		
			<p>“An interview like this could save my career and move it forward.” Evan said quickly.</p>
		
			<p>“And there it is. The honestly I saw yesterday. Only this time you didn’t have to drink to say it”
			Peter said without the anger in his voice.</p>
		
			<p>“Wait did I ask you this yesterday?” Evan said very confused.</p>
		
			<p>“Yes, you were slurring your words and I couldn’t understand you for a while, but when you found out my 
			name, you started begging for an interview. You said it would save your career and that it would help you move 
			forward.” Peter explained.</p>
		
			<p>“Wait, I said all this while drunk?” Evan said even more confused.</p>
			
			<p>“Well in so many words. Too be far I am interpreting what you said yesterday, 
			you were very drunk and I had trouble understanding you.” Peter explained again.</p>
			
			<p>“Fuck. I can’t believe I did that, so what is this interview over?” Evan said worried.</p>
			
			<p>“Actually no, it just got started. But we may need some assistance.” Peter said as he got out a bottle
			of whiskey.</p>
			
			<p>“Do I have to do this?” Evan said looking at the bottle.</p>
			
			<p>“This is the only way we will both be honest” Peter said cracking a smile.</p>
			
			<p>Peter opened the bottle and poured two glasses while laughing. While Peter sat, Evan was thankful he didn’t
			tell his boss about the interview, because he wouldn’t be fine with this. They lifted up their glasses and 
			Evan realized he could not get out of this. They started to drink and the questions started to get more 
			personal. All professionalism had been thrown out the window as Evan asked questions about Peter’s sex life,
			screwing competitors over, and breaking the law. Peter answered all questions and the answers were all over 
			the place. Peter had lived an amazing life that no one had heard about. He had done some incredible things in
			his life that he had told no one else. Things were going well until Evan blacked out and woke up in the bathtub.</p>
			
			<p>Evan had a sharp pain in his head and wanted to get rid of everything in his stomach much like the last
			morning. Already in the bathroom, Evan repeated what he did in the morning. After about 30 minutes he left the
			bathroom and saw he ended up back in his hotel room. He saw it became night. He checked his phone and the read
			out as 2 in the morning. Evan then remembered the unconventional interview he did yesterday. He started
			worrying wondering what to tell his boss until he saw his recorder and notepad on the bed. He picked up the 
			recorder and started playing it, the first thing he heard where his basic questions followed by Peter’s 
			outburst. The sound of pouring whiskey followed the outburst, and that the questions got strange. He did not
			remember the barrage of questions he asked or the equally strange answers he got. Evan knew he could make an
			amazing piece but he knew his boss would hate it if he found out the reporter drank on the job. Just as he
			thought of what to do he heard a knock at his door followed by Peter asking how he felt. Evan opened the door
			and let him in.</p>
			
			<p>“So it may have been a mistake to finish off that bottle.” Peter said jokingly.</p>
			
			<p>“God, why did I get day drunk two days in a row?” Evan said worried.</p>
			
			<p>“Well hey, you got an amazing interview out of it.” Peter said in a happy tone.</p>
			
			<p>“Yeah but it’s virtually unusable, if my boss finds out I drank I’ll get fired.” Evan said annoyed.</p>
			
			<p>“You know if you hate that job so much why don’t you quit. I’d help you find a job and trust me a letter
			of recommendation from me will do you wonders.” Peter said as he got up.</p>
			
			<p>“Wait seriously, you would do that?” Evan said surprised.</p>
			
			<p>“Of course, I had the most genuine interview with you and would love to help you out. Also you have a 
			lot of dirt on me in that recording so this would make us even. You already have my number so just call me 
			in the morning with your answer, now if you excuse me I am going to sleep for a very long time.” Peter said 
			as he left the room.</p>
			
			<p>Evan sat and thought about the offer. With a letter of recommendation like that he could write anywhere. 
			He could finally get real stories and cover actual news. He sat there looking at his phone wondering what to
			do. He then decided one more drink couldn’t hurt and took one of the tiny bottle of vodka out of the mini
			fridge. After drinking it he sent an email with the subject letter of resignation to his boss. Evan then laid 
			down and fell asleep. That interview may not have saved his job but honestly he’s glad it didn’t.</p>
