			<h1>I Keep Coming Back to Stardew Valley</h1>
			<img src="images/stardew.jpg" alt="Stardew Valley" width="930" height="450" /><br>
			<p> Stardew Valley is a simple game about inheriting a farm. You basically get to play the game anyway
			you want to play. The game came out in 2016, and even though I have other games to play (I still haven't 
			finished Devel May Cry 5) I keep coming back to it. If I had to say why I guess I would have to be the life
			I have in the game. As weird as that sounds I genuinely care about my fictional farm and want to take care of
			it. I want the people in the fictional town to do well and want them to like me. I want to explore the mines
			and fish everywhere. It's a form of escapism for me I guess. I can leave my normal life for this fictional life
			where I have other people to take care of and people to help. I don't think I'll ever stop playing this game
			and honestly I look forward to see the state of it in a couple years.</p>
