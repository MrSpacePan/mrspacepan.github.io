			<h1>Watch Adventure Time</h1>
			<img src="images/adventure time.jpg" alt="Adventure Time" width="930" height="450" /><br>
			<p> I recently finished Adventure Time after starting in December of last year. The finale
			happened last year as well and even though I would've loved to watch it when it happened I couldn't.
			I was watching the show and keeping up to date but half way through season eight I had fallen off
			and never picked it up again. I had wanted to re watch the series after it ended so I could have
			the entire show fresh in my mind when I watched the finale. Next thing you know Hulu decided to
			have a huge sale and shortly afterward season ten dropped on Hulu. Combine those together and you 
			get what I can only describe as an emotional six month rollar coaster.</p>
			
			<p>The couple seasons of Adventure Time follow a very standard formula. Finn and Jake go on an adventure
			and hijinks ensue. A lot of complaint's I have about early seasons fall a bit under the "grown man watching
			a children's show" umbrella, but overall I still can recomend it. The first season is definately the most
			kid's show season it has but it's still has some great episodes (Lost in Lumpy Space is a personal favorite)
			but if you want to skip it you won't miss much, aside from some lore that's important later. If you only watch
			one or two episodes from the first season watch the finale with the Lich King because that is very important 
			in the long run. The next couple seasons are similar but have more serious episodes that keep you watching.
			The episodes that definately hit the hardest are the ones we're we learn more about The Ice King. You learn
			about his past as a man named Simon who found a crown that drove him insane. You learn that years of using
			his crown has made him go mad causing him to forget everything about his past life. Every episode that revealed
			more of his past made tears roll down my face. The show gradually gives you these episodes but then season five
			happens.</p>
			
			<p>Season five is the longest season but it's also the season that cements Adventure Time as a show for adults
			just as much as kids. The season starts with a look at an alternate reality that is on the brink of nuclear 
			destruction. As one character lives through it and starts to go insane another has to find a way to stop it.
			During this season the main character grows as we see him enter a relationship and lose it though his own
			selfishness. We learn more about Simon and see his decent to madness. We see two characters grow closer 
			that originally seemed distant. We see a dystopian society under strict rule from a mad dictator get overthrown
			through the power of hope in the future. There's so much in this season that I am giving the footnotes to make
			it fit in this paragraph. The season ends with the main character growing as he get's over one of his fears and
			learns his father is alive. This season is the one that made me fall in love with the show, and every season after
			that added on to that.</p>
			
			<p>After season five the show continued to grow in scope. It still was able to stay a kid's show but it was also 
			able to be more. Season six is about the main character coming to terms with the actions of his father and trying
			to prevent a comet from destroying the world. Season seven give's us more lore and shows us the life of one of the
			shows core characters. Season eight shows us what happened to Finn's mother and it's genuinely heartbreaking. Season
			nine shows the world on the brink of war. And season 10 is a build up to a final battle that ends the series.</p>
			
			<p>The final episode of Adventure Time is what I consider a true finale. Over the course of six months I sat and
			watched this entire show. I watched ten seasons of characters growing and changing. I watched enemies become
			friends and I watched friends become more. This show really hit me hard and it's honestly what I needed. I was 
			able to go back to simpler time and also look at the future with optimism. As I sat there while the finale finished,
			and I looked back on the whole show I started to cry. Not because I was sad, but because I was content. I can't really 
			say more than that, all I can say is go watch Adventure Time, trust me.</p>
